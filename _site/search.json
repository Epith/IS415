    "text": "2.0 Getting Started\nData are key to data analytics including geospatial analytics. Hence, before analysing, we need to assemble the necessary data. In this hands-on exercise, you are required to extract the necessary data sets from the following sources:\n\nMaster Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) from data.gov.sg\nPre-Schools Location from data.gov.sg\nCycling Path from LTADataMall\nLatest version of Singapore Airbnb listing data from Inside Airbnb\n\n\n2.1 Extracting the geospatial data sets\nNext, at the Hands-on_Ex01 folder, create a sub-folder called data. Then, inside the data sub-folder, create two sub-folders and name them geospatial and aspatial respectively.\nPlace Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web), Pre-Schools Location and Cycling Path zipped files into geospatial sub-folder and unzipped them. Copy the unzipped files from their respective sub-folders and place them inside geospatial sub-folder.\n\n\n2.2 Extracting the aspatial data set\nNow, you will extract the downloaded listing data file. At Downloads folder, cut and paste listing.csv into aspatial sub-folder.\n\n\n2.3 Install R-Package\nIn this hands-on exercise, two R packages will be used. They are:\n\nsf for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data, and\ntidyverse for performing data science tasks such as importing, wrangling and visualising data.\n\nTidyverse consists of a family of R packages. In this hands-on exercise, the following packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv data,\nreadxl for importing Excel worksheet,\ntidyr for manipulating data,\ndplyr for transforming data, and\nggplot2 for visualising data\n\nEnter the following:\n\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)"
